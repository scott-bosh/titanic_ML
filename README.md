# Titanic Survival Prediction
## Machine Learning from Disaster

### Overview
This project tackles the legendary Titanic Machine Learning competition from Kaggle - a perfect introduction to ML competitions and predictive modeling. The goal is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using machine learning techniques.

### The Challenge
On April 15, 1912, the widely considered "unsinkable" RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren't enough lifeboats for everyone on board, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others. This project aims to build a predictive model that answers the question: "What sorts of people were more likely to survive?" using passenger data (name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.).

### Dataset Description

#### Files
- `train.csv` - Training set
- `test.csv` - Test set
- `sample_submission.csv` - Sample submission file in the correct format

#### Features
| Variable | Definition | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| survival | Survival | 0 = No, 1 = Yes |
| pclass | Ticket class | 1 = 1st (Upper), 2 = 2nd (Middle), 3 = 3rd (Lower) |
| sex | Sex | |
| age | Age in years | - Fractional if less than 1 year<br>- Estimated ages end in .5 |
| sibsp | Number of siblings/spouses aboard | Includes:<br>- Siblings: brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister<br>- Spouse: husband, wife (excludes mistresses/fianc√©s) |
| parch | Number of parents/children aboard | Includes:<br>- Parents: mother, father<br>- Children: daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson<br>Note: Children with nanny only have parch=0 |
| ticket | Ticket number | |
| fare | Passenger fare | |
| cabin | Cabin number | |
| embarked | Port of Embarkation | C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton |

### Getting Started

1. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Data Exploration**
   - Explore the training data
   - Analyze feature distributions
   - Identify patterns in survival rates

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Handle missing values
   - Create new features
   - Encode categorical variables

4. **Model Development**
   - Train different models
   - Perform cross-validation
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters

5. **Make Predictions**
   - Generate predictions on test set
   - Create submission file

### Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated on accuracy (percentage of correctly predicted passengers).

### Tips for Success
- Start with simple models and gradually increase complexity
- Pay attention to feature engineering
- Consider ensemble methods
- Use cross-validation to avoid overfitting
- Analyze feature importance
- Study patterns in different passenger groups
